## 💡 Usage / Examples
Once you open the index.html file in your browser, you'll see a sleek, responsive product showcase with the following behavior:

🧾 How It Works

- 🖼️ Product Grid

    The layout displays multiple product cards side-by-side.

    Each card contains:

    - A product image

    - A name/title

    - A price

    - An "Add to Cart" button with an icon

- 🖱️ Hover Effects
Card Hover: The entire card lifts with a subtle shadow and scale effect.

Button Hover: The button zooms in slightly and changes color smoothly.

- 📱 Responsive Layout
On large screens, cards are arranged in a neat grid (3–4 per row).

On tablets/mobiles, they automatically stack vertically for better readability.

- ✅ Interactive Feel
Font Awesome icons add clarity and a modern touch.

All animations are handled via CSS transitions — no JavaScript needed.

- 🔄 Example Flow
    - Open the index1.html file.

    - Browse the grid of products.

    - Hover over a card — watch it lift with shadow.

    - Click the “Add to Cart” button to simulate user interaction.

    - Resize the browser to see the responsive behavior.
